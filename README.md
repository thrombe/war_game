## Problem statement #24
 Use the [Standard deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck) to create a simplified version of the game [War](https://cardgames.fandom.com/wiki/War). In this game, there are two players. Each starts with half of a deck. The players each deal the top card from their decks and whoever has the higher card wins the other playerâ€™s cards and adds them to the bottom of his deck. If there is a tie, the two cards are eliminated from play (this differs from the actual game, but is simpler to program). The game ends when one player runs out of cards.

##### possible code improvements
  - [x] use [enum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html)
  - [ ] improve the [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)

##### how more efficient?:
  - [x] multiprocessing
    - need to use the [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) library as the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) does not allow python threads to run concurrently
    - [ ] check if [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11312525/catch-ctrlc-sigint-and-exit-multiprocesses-gracefully-in-python/35134329#35134329) is needed
  - [ ] use deque in the simulation as inserting at index 0 is very slow
    - store the tuple in this and not the Card as described below
      - no refcounting this way ig
  - [ ] implement the deque using numpy arrays
    - only ranks matter for the game, so they should be filled with only ranks
    - but how do i collect data on freq of each rank being left at the end?
      - maybe store a tuple in it instead: ```(<rank>, <index in deck>)```
    - why would this be faster with numpy if i use deque anyway?
  - [ ] implement this in a faster language like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cpp](https://isocpp.org/)
    - implementing this in rust and then using matplotlib to visualise this data should be easy as [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) can be used to generate a python lib, when can then be used in a python environment just like regualr python functions/classes

##### metrics i can gather info on:
  - [x] freq of turns
  - [x] freq of the number of cards left 
  - [ ] freq of each rank being left at the end
  - [ ] freq of each rank having a tie in the game
    - should be possible to just calculate the probability of this happening :/
