## Problem statement #24
 Use the [Standard deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck) to create a simplified version of the game [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)). In this game, there are two players. Each starts with half of a deck. The players each deal the top card from their decks and whoever has the higher card wins the other playerâ€™s cards and adds them to the bottom of his deck. If there is a tie, the two cards are eliminated from play (this differs from the actual game, but is simpler to program). The game ends when one player runs out of cards.
